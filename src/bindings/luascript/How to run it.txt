HOWTO run it ( by Derex )

ON WINDOWS:
-----------
1.you need to download boost (boost.org)
2.extract boost and copy /boost dir ... ( you need to have \src\bindings\luascript\boost\cast.hpp in this order )
3.Open your mangos-project with vs2003 
4.remove script project
5.File->add project->add existing project and navigate to luascript.vcproj
6.copy contents of lua-scripts folder where your mangosd.exe is , so that Masterscript.lua is just where is your mangosd.exe
8.you are ready ... compile and run ... :)

ON LINUX
